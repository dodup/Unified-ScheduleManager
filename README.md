# Unified Schedule Manager

A software running as a `windows service` that host a web server on **`https://localhost:3131`** that allow the user to create `schedules` based on `day of week` and `time of day` and execute an OpenPipe script that writes to some variables in the locally running `WinCC Unified PC RT` application if the each schedule is currently `true` or `false`.

I also provide in this example how we can leverage the npm module [node-windows](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-windows) to run a JavaScript file "as a service" in a Windows environment.

## Installation Steps

1. **Download** the file package `USM_V1.1.0.zip` from the `Releases` section on the right.
2. **Unzip** the files to any location on the WinCC Unified PC RT station.
3. **Run** the `/src/Install_RunAsAdmin.bat` file as **administrator**.
   - If you want to change default port of _`3131`_ change the `const PORT = 3131` inside **app.js** to whatever port you want to use.

## Uninstallation step

1. **Run** the `/src/Uninstall_RunAsAdmin` file as **administrator** to uninstall the service.
   \*Will delete the service even if it's currently running.

## Steps in TIA Portal

1. **Download** the file `UnifiedScheduleManager.zal20` from this repository and open it in the **Global libraries** (compressed) area of TIA Portal.

### **_The library_** provided contains:

1. **Master copies** that contain:
   - Example tag table `UnifiedScheduleManager` the array tag **`_SCHEDMAN_[0..99]`**
     -- You can define the array size to your need, it doesn't matter.
   - Example of usage (`ExampleScreen`).

### **_Engineering_** a project:

1. Simply create one internal tag named:
   - `_SCHEDMAN_` of datatype **Array of [0..x] Bool** (maximum of 2000 (0..1999) elements for arrays in WinCC Unified!)
2. Navigate at `https://localhost:3131` either with WinCC Web Control object or with your own web browser and create your schedules.
   - The field `Array Index` that you need to provide when creating a schedule is associated to the array index of your HMI Tag `_SCHEDMAN_`

### **_Re-creating certificates_**:

I've created a Self Signed certificate using [_OpenSSL_](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) with a validity of **10 years** (expires on: Thursday, May 10, 2035 at 3:40:06â€¯PM) and I know 10 years might be a bad thing for cyber security, but you can create you own certificate with installing OpenSSL 3.5 for Windows, then:

1. Open a _CMD Prompt_ as **Administrator**
2. Navigate to the installation directory, eg: **`cd C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin`**
3. Run the following command:
   **`openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365`** - This will create a 365 day valid certificate in `C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin`, as a **cert.pem** and **key.pem**, that should be **placed in the Unified Schedule Manager folder, alongside the app.js**. - If you change the name of the .pem's, make sure you change also in the app.js file. - If the service was installed, you can uninstall it and install it again, you will keep the schedule as the schedules.db file already exist.

   - _Make sure to do your due diligence for cyber risk with certificates, I'm not a cryptography expert._

## Tested scope

This has only be tested with `WinCC Unified PC RT V20`.
