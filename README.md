# Unified Schedule Manager
A software running as a `windows service` that host a web server on **`https://localhost:3131`** that allow the user to create `schedules` based on `day of week` and `time of day` and execute an OpenPipe script that writes to some variables in the locally running `WinCC Unified PC RT` application if the each schedule is currently `true` or `false`.

I also provide in this example how we can leverage the npm module [node-windows](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-windows) to run a JavaScript file "as a service" in a Windows environment.

## Installation Steps
1. **Download** the file package `USM_V1.0.0.zip` from the `Releases` section on the right.
2. **Unzip** the files to any location on the WinCC Unified PC RT station.
3. **Run** the `/src/Install_RunAsAdmin.bat` file as **administrator**.
	- (If you want to change default port of *`3131`* change the `const PORT = 3131` inside **app.js** to whatever port you want to use.

## Uninstallation step
1. **Run** the `/src/Uninstall_RunAsAdmin` file as **administrator** to uninstall the service.
*Will delete the service even if it's currently running.

## Steps in TIA Portal
1. **Download** the file `UnifiedScheduleManager.zal20` from this repository and open it in the **Global libraries** (compressed) area of TIA Portal.

### ***The library*** provided contains:
1. **Master copies** that contain:
   - Example tag table `UnifiedScheduleManager` the array tag **`_SCHEDMAN_[0..99]`**
   -- You can define the array size to your need, it doesn't matter.
   - Example of usage (`ExampleScreen`).

### ***Engineering*** a project:
1. Simply create one internal tag named:
   - `_SCHEDMAN_` of datatype **Array of [0..x] Bool**.

### ***Re-creating certificates***:
I've created a Self Signed certificate using [*OpenSSL*](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) with a validity of **10 years** (expires on: Thursday, May 10, 2035 at 3:40:06â€¯PM) and I know 10 years might be a bad thing for cyber security, but you can create you own certificate with installing OpenSSL 3.5 for Windows, then:
1. Open a *CMD Prompt* as **Administrator**
2. Navigate to the installation directory, eg: **`cd C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin`**
3. Run the following command: 
**`openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365`**
		- This will create a 365 day valid certificate in `C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin`, as a **cert.pem** and **key.pem**, that should be **placed in the Unified Schedule Manager folder, alongside the app.js**. 
		- If you change the name of the .pem's, make sure you change also in the app.js file. 
		- If the service was installed, you can uninstall it and install it again, you will keep the schedule as the schedules.db file already exist.

### ***Known limitations***:
1. If you use a **WinCC Object '*Web Browser*'** with url `https://loalhost:3131`, you won't be able to "delete" schedules from there, as the confirmation popup doesn't work in that browser. I need to create an embedded popup.

2. Currently, the HMI Tag `_SCHEDMAN_[0]` is associated with the first entry of the schedule list of the schedule database, the `_SHEDMAN_[1]` is associated to the second entry and so on. So if you use [1] in your code and for some reason you delete [0], then in the 'order' of the schedules, the [1] will become [0], because it's always from top to bottom. So you'll need to use [0] in your logic instead of [0]. I need to create a way of mapping the index that you want into the schedule entries of the web application.

## Tested scope

This has only be tested with `WinCC Unified PC RT V20`.
